Hello There!
I present to you "Kalvik", an aim training web game that requires you to trace and click the Kalvium logo moving around on your screen.

This game has been inspired by the GeekForGeek HTML, CSS and JS game. Although the mechanics of the game might seem similar, I had to rework the website in its entirety to deliver the end product. Here is the link for the game idea : https://res.cloudinary.com/dvfeh6kup/image/upload/v1667556163/tapthegeek1_jdwrqy.gif

Additions that were implemented to this basic idea are listed below :
(1) A login page.
(2) An end screen.
(3) On click animations.
(4) The entire structure + design.
(5) Added timer + a more efficient scoreboard.
(6) Background Music.
(7) Every click on the logo makes a fireworks sound.
(8) End screen displays your nickname [which was earlier given access to via the login page] as well as end score + a random motivational quote intended to make you try the game again.

Instructions to play the game :
(1) Enter your username + nickname and click "Start".
(2) Once inside the game webpage, click on desired game mode.
(3) Once clicked, a Kalvium logo appears and starts moving in a fixed path [this was done using CSS Animations].
(4) Depending on which mode you have chosen, a timer as well as speed of the movement differs. [Easy - Relatively slow and 20s time. Medium - Increased speed and 15s time. Hard - Max speed and 12s time.]
(5) Your objective as a player is to get maximum amount of clicks on the Kalvium logo before the timer runs out.

Have fun!
